# FetchAgents.txt
# List of agent repositories used by CMake's FetchContent integration.
#
# Format:
#   <id> <git-url> [revision=<branch|tag|commit>] [path=<subdir>]
#
# - <id> is a short identifier used in CMake to name the project when fetched.
# - <git-url> is the HTTPS or SSH URL for the repository.
# - revision= is optional and can be a branch, tag or commit hash.
# - path= is optional and specifies a subdirectory within the repo to use.
#
# Example entries:
#   agent-core https://github.com/example/agent-core.git revision=v1.2.0
#   utils https://github.com/example/agent-utils.git revision=main path=cmake
#
# Notes for CMake usage:
# - A small helper CMake script can parse this file and call FetchContent_Declare
#   for each line, passing the URL and GIT_TAG (from revision=) and optionally
#   the SOURCE_SUBDIR if path= is provided.
# - Keep this file in the project root (or point CMake at it) and update when
#   adding/removing agents.

# --- Begin agent list (edit below) ---
# Placeholder entries — replace with real repos used by your project.
agent-core https://github.com/example/agent-core.git revision=main
agent-utils https://github.com/example/agent-utils.git revision=v0.3.1 path=cmake
agent-network https://github.com/example/agent-network.git revision=feature/cmake-integration

# --- End agent list ---

# If you want me to populate this file from an existing FetchAgents.txt
# somewhere else (for example: ~/Code/gismo_worktrees/worktrees/agents/cmake/),
# paste the file contents or allow me to read that path and I'll copy the entries.
